# Connect-Four-Game
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column,six row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight within the column.
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical,or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
Connect four is a solved game.The first player can always win by playing the right moves:smile:
